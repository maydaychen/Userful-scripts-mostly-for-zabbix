# background
In the process of using Zabbix for monitoring, I've found that many things require custom monitoring item configurations. The built-in ones aren't quite enough, so I've organized this project to record some scripts that I personally find useful, hoping they can help everyone.

There are scripts for Linux, written in Shell, and for Windows, written in PowerShell. 
Feel free to use them as needed, and I hope everyone can communicate more and share more.
